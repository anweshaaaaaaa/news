    <p> India gasps for oxygen
      Our nation is facing the worst surge in covid and is in the middle of an incapacitating shortage of oxygen . The second wave has been taking a toll on Indians since early February. And it has exposed the incompetence of our government, all the
      gaps and fissures of the medical infrastructure. It has failed terribly in handling the pandemic, which came with visible warnings. The government had ample time to prepare for it, but the government turned out to be a failure.
      Patients under home isolation are not getting oxygen cylinders because of the acute shortage. The prices of refilling and renting, and panic hoarding by people, have skyrocketed, and that’s why people who have money are turning towards black
      marketers for something as basic as oxygen, which should be available for everyone. Someone who has no money. Is facing the tragedy.
      India has a record of approximately 35000 deaths, mostly unreported. No records of deaths due to lack of oxygen. India produces 7127 MT of oxygen daily. Medical requirement has increased by 76% in 10 days from 3842 MT to 6785 MT. Before the
      pandemic, India required 750-800 LMO, the rest was for industrial use, now the industrial supply has been completely cut off.
      According to LMO manufacturers, production is a problem, but transporting it to nooks and corners of rural India is the bigger problem. The last resort is the 50000 MT of oxygen that is expected to receive through the import route.
